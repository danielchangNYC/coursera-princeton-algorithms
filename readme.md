# Coursera Algorithms

Big Ideas:
  - There's a scientific approach to designing and analyzing algorithms.
    - Build mathematical model of the problem
    - Find algorithm to solve it
    - Evaluate speed and memory (Big O)
    - Iterate improvements
  - For each alg
    - What does the data structure look like? (behaviors?)
    - Implementations && costs?
