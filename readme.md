# Coursera Algorithms

Big Ideas:
  - There's a scientific approach to designing and analyzing algorithms.
    - Build mathematical model of the problem
    - Find algorithm to solve it
    - Evaluate speed and memory (Big O)
    - Iterate improvements
  - For each alg
    - What does the data structure look like? (behaviors?)
    - Implementations && costs?

Algorithms:
  - Union Find
    - Quick Find
    - Quick Union
      - Weighted
      - Compressed
  - Binary Search
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Shellsort
  - **Mergesort**
  - **Quicksort**
  - Quick Select (related to quick sort)
  - 3-way quick sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Sequential Search

Data Structures:
  - Stacks
  - Queues
