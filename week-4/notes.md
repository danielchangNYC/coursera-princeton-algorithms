# Week 4: Priority Queues, Elementary Symbol Tables

## Priority Queues

Remove item of highest priority (min or max)

### HEAPS

A heap is a binary tree with a few special properties:
  1) Shape Property
     - Binary heap is a complete binary tree.
       - This means all nodes of a level must be filled out before moving on to the next
  2) Heap property
     - Conforms to an ordering: all parent nodes will have the same size property in relation to all of its children
     - So, min heap -> all parents will be smaller than children, max heap -> all parents larger than children
